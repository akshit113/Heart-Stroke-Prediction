# Heart Stroke Prediction

![Header](download.jpg)

According to the [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/) (WHO), [heart stroke](https://www.who.int/cardiovascular_diseases/resources/cvd_report.pdf) is the 2nd leading 
cause of death globally, responsible for approximately 11% of total deaths. 
This kaggle [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset) 
is used to predict whether a patient is likely to get stroke based on the 
input parameters like gender, age, various diseases, and smoking status. 
Each row in the data provides relevant information about the patient.


The aim of this project is to develop a vanilla front-end/UI web application for our 
ML model using [StreamLit.io](https://streamlit.io/) platform, which is an open-source app framework for creating 
beautiful data apps. The app is served on streamlit [here](https://share.streamlit.io/akshit113/heart-stroke-prediction/main/app.py).
