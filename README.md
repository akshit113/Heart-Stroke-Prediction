# Heart Stroke Prediction
According to the World Health Organization (WHO) stroke is the 2nd leading 
cause of death globally, responsible for approximately 11% of total deaths. 
This dataset is used to predict whether a patient is likely to get stroke based on the 
input parameters like gender, age, various diseases, and smoking status. 
Each row in the data provides relevant information about the patient.


The aim of this project is to learn to develop a front-end (UI/web application) for a 
basic ML model using StreamLit which is an open-source app framework for creating 
beautiful data apps. The app will be hosted on Heroku PaaS.
